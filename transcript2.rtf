No, but what's the, so we're a weekly, so that's like a three-year view that we kind of had open, maybe even something?\
Yeah, about two, three. So it sort of had this almost like head and shoulders kind of thing, but, and it, but it seems to be on the bottom of it, like we're kind of on the, on the bottom of where it, where it trades.\
And even on a short term, you know, it's been pretty stagnant within that range, and then it's sort of dropping down here lately.\
But now what we're seeing is sort of a series of drops to the bottom, but with, with, that had mostly bearish.\
Volume. And lately even, well, it kind of had that spike and then had that one spike, but I don't know, it's kind of jumping around a little bit.\
But now most recently, what we're seeing is some more, like in the last three weeks, we've had that more buyers and the, well, last week was a short week though, so it's a little bit.\

And then it's a possible bounce, but, because it seems to have some good reward opportunity with low risk, but.\

\f1\b0 \
So tomorrow I get to see if this turns into a hammer, right? Kind of for me, the big clue here, this one, right?\
We're in a clear downtrend. thing's just dumping like crazy. And then we get that increasing volume with a clear shift from sellers being in control to buyers taking control, right?\
When you have increasing volume with a doji, it's usually a sign of accumulation or distribution. In this case, given that we were dumping and then we got the doji candle, I would argue this is accumulation.\
And also we have buyers here. So I would say, hey, this accumulation last week was short. We kind of traded sideways this week.\
Now we don't have increasing volume yet, but I would argue. 50% of the volume is buyers. So would I make a decision on it today?\
Probably not. If I can see increasing volume on this tomorrow, right, to the upside, I would say, hey, we have ourselves a trade here.\
Now, let's assume that we want to take a trade on it today. My next question to you, well, obviously, we kind of both agree, right, the buyers are kind of stepping in here.\
We would have to play this to the upside and be bullish on it.\

So if this was like a $500 or $600 stock, 100%, I'm like, hey, you know, a price target, $50 or $60 above, I would totally agree with you, right?\
Given that it's a $200 stock, though, we're very limited, really, as to what a price target can be. Because we can't realistically expect there to be a higher than 10% move on, right?\
So I would argue, you know, normally the last time we spoke, I told you, hey, previous swing highs are your price target, right?\
Which is what you went to, and that's usually correct. But in this case, given that we're trading at 200, I would argue the high of this candle is about 10% away.\
I would make this my price target, which is around 220. So I would say it's realistic for me to say that we can move from 200 to 220, you know, by the end of the month or early January, right?\
So that would be my price target. I'm just starting the chart. So now the next question is like, hey, how many candles do you think it's going to take for us to get to that 220?\

\f0\b leo gonzalez (Kajabi)
\f1\b0 \
It's got to be double, right? The amount of time we're going to be in the trade. Therefore, our expiration would have to be like early February, right?\
Because we're willing to stay in this trade till essentially early January. And we want to leave some time on the contract available kind of for the next person, right?\
So now just reviewing where we're at, right? We're bullish. We have a price target of 220 and we think it's going to hit within the next four weeks.\
We figured out our expiration. So now we have to figure out two things. One, we have to figure out our strike price, right?\
If we go like a straight call or we have to keep in mind, is it more profitable to do a debit spread than it is to buy a straight call, right?\
So we're going to backtest both of them. So let's start with the straight call. What strike would you buy?\

Gosh. This is C-H-P-T? C-H-P-T-R, yeah. Hold on a second. And we'd be looking at the, we said, you said the January 26th.\
C-T-R, expiration, essentially, end of January or the first week of February would be fine. right. So, and the money split is around the 150, between 150 and 155.\
That's just based on the current price, though, I guess. rumourw, um So you're saying, what do we want to, I mean, but am I correct in saying, though, that we would ideally want to be in the money on our strike, right?\

We don't have it here, but we'll go December 18th. What does 50% look like? Like where does price need to go for me to make 50% on December 18th?\
And you start scrolling down and you could see, hey, if we go to 215 by December 18th, I will hit my 50% profit.\

So, you know, looking at the whole chart, you can see like, hey, technically, we don't get above 210 fast.\

But where's the break-even? The break-even is the white. Right. So, which means that at that two-week point, though, in other words, even if it only goes up like $2 or whatever, we break-even.\

\f1\b0 \
But, yeah, mean, yeah, you're right. Essentially, like, as long as by the $18, we get to $205, you know, we're fine.\
Like, it, I'll get out if I have to. We'll reanalyze it. We'll reanalyze it, and we'll see what the volume is doing and stuff.\
Now, this is buying that $205, right? Is that what we went with? Let me make sure. No, $210, sorry.\
We bought the $210. Now, I want to throw a crazy idea at you. What if, you know, what if we don't buy the $210?\
What if I'm like, hey, you know what? Like, there's too much freaking red here, and the green is, like, all up in this corner.\
I want to see a little more green on this side, right? I want to see it more, like, flat than just in this corner.\
Sure. So let me go and do the same thing again, right? But I'm going to do now the, I'm going to buy at the money.\
And I want to see if it's worth it, right? See if the, it's obviously going to be a little more expensive, but I want to check out if it's worth my time to maybe do this one instead.\
So instead of buying that $210 for $880, I'm going to buy that $200 for $13, right? And we're going to do the same thing.\
We're go $175, and we're going to go $225. We're going to calculate. And now, do you see how that break-even is not as diagonal?\

\f0\b leo gonzalez (Kajabi)
\f1\b0 \
Like, hey, if we go to $215, then you hold until expiration, like, you still make $300 bucks on it.\
You know what I mean? Like, it's just, it looks a little better. And I have the other one here.\
You can see the difference. Like, this is freaking diagonal. We better go off where there's no money to be made here.\
And over here, it's a little more like, hey, we need an initial kind of bump, and then we could slowly go up.\

\f1\b0 \
Right, right, exactly. So now you're like, hey, which one do I want to go with? Do I want to risk $800 or $900, essentially, on a riskier one, or do I want to go the extra mile and go with a safer one?\
But obviously, it's $1,300 instead, right? So you would make a choice out of those. Option number three, it's like, hey, what if we do a call debit spread at the money?\
Because that's really kind of where we do the best, right? And we buy the $2,100, sell the $2,500. So now I'm going to go again to that options possible calculator.\
the bottom here. So Okay. And we're going to go with a call spread, which is a call debit spread.\
And we're going to do same CHTR, price. And then we're doing January 16. Now, here's a problem, right, that I didn't run into earlier.\
The person that I was working with earlier, they went with a January 23rd, right? So what's the difference? January 16 only has $10 spreads.\
I don't like doing $10 debit spreads. I like doing fives. So I would actually go with a January 23rd expiration for the debit spread.\
And again, I would buy the $200. Uh-huh.\

\f0\b leo gonzalez (Kajabi)
\f1\b0 \
And then I'm going to do, this is only going to cost me $240, right? So now it's like, hey, what if I want to buy three?\
Like I didn't want to spend $900 on the straight call, right? And I obviously didn't want to spend $1,300 on the at the money one.\
So what if I do three debit spreads here at the money, you know, and that's going to cost me $720.\
What does the profit cost? $225, we calculate, and here it's totally different. You see how all we really need is for price to go to $206, $207?\
And the longer you hold this, the more money you make up until you make that full profit. So obviously we want it to go to $220, you know what I mean?\
Like that's what we're hoping for. Hey, the sooner we get up here, the better it is for us. But even if we catch a $7 move...\
And we stay stagnant, you, Theta starts working for you, and you start milking, right, all the profit off of that trade.\
And that urgency to get out of the trade that you're going to feel with buying a straight call, goes away, man, the second the price goes above your spread.\
Because now, the longer you hold it, the more money you make. So, overall, it's a much more peaceful strategy.\
There's no stress when you do a debit spread and you go past your spread.\

\f1\b0 \
It's increasing buyers. Oh, right, right. Yeah. So it's not, but it's not increasing volume. Now, that's a great signal as well.\
The market makers don't want to have increasing volume, right? Because they don't want to give it out that they're about to skyrocket the stock, right?\
So you do have a shift from like, hey, sellers were present to now buyers are 100% in control, right?\
No increasing volume, but it's close, and then you have this explosive move the last two days. So be aware, when you see stuff like that, there's still a trait to be taken.\
